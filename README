LocDoc - Lua Open Computers Documentation
    A specification and tool for documenting lua code in Open Computers.

Documentation is defined in comments. Comments must appear as follows:
---
-- block comment
---
    Block comments start with '---' on a separate line and end with
    '---' on a separate line.
--- inline comment
    Single comments start with '---' on the same line.

Documentation is defined in yaml.

Output is generated by parsing all source files in given directory for
comments. Before output is generated it is left in an intermediate format,
this allows custom output formats. The default formats are man and
markdown for their simplicity and support on github and terminals.
